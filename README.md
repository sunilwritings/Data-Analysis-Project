Objective:

The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the
University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery
for breast cancer.

Generated Insights Through Different Plotting Techniques:

1.Survival status is low between the age 40 to 60 years.
2.Higher number of deaths survived below 10 nodes of detection.
3.Higher deaths recorded in the age between 40 to 60.
4.Age between 40-60 have more deaths with nodes detected below 10.
5.Operation year 1960-65 have recoreded more deaths.
6.irrespective of age persons with 0 nodes detected survived.
7.Most number of deaths occured at the age between 40 to 70.
8.Survival rate is high when nodes detected below 3.
9.Almost 85% survived when nodes detected below 10.
10.Almost 40% survived when the age below 48.
11..Patients survival rate is high when nodes detected below 3 and the average age below 52.
12.Higher number of deaths recorded in the operation year between 1960-1965.
13.Finally age between 40 to 60 and nodes detected below 3 survival rate is high.
